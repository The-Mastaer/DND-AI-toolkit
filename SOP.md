SOP: Creating Your First World
Welcome to the new, world-centric version of the DM's AI Toolkit! This guide will walk you through the first and most important step: creating the container for all your stories.

The Core Concept: Worlds vs. Campaigns
Think of a World as your entire setting. It's the foundational reality where your stories happen. It holds the core lore, the maps, the gods, and the universal rules. Examples could be "Forgotten Realms," "Eberron," or your own homebrew setting like "The Shattered Isles."

A Campaign is a specific adventure with a specific group of players that takes place within that world. You can have multiple campaigns running in the same world.

Step-by-Step Guide
Launch the Toolkit

Run the application. You'll see the main menu.

Open the World Manager

Click the "Launch World Manager" button. This takes you to your new command center.

Create a New World

In the World Manager, click the "+ New" button in the bottom-left corner. This will clear the editing panel on the right, ready for your input.

Define Your World's First Translation

World Name: Give your setting a unique and evocative name (e.g., "Veridia," "Aethelgard"). This will be the name for the primary language you are writing in.

World Lore: This is the most important field. Think of it as your "World Anvil" or your private Wikipedia entry. This is where you write the core truths of your setting in your primary language.

What is the creation myth?

Who are the major gods?

What are the key historical events?

How does magic work?

What are the main continents or kingdoms?

The AI will use this text as the ultimate source of truth for all future generations within this world.

Save Your World

Click the "Save World" button. Your new world will now appear in the list on the left.

Congratulations! You have successfully created the foundational setting for your adventures. Your world is now saved and ready.

What's Next?
With your world selected, the next step is to click "Manage Campaigns" to start creating the specific stories and adventures that will take place within it. You can also add translations for your world in other languages later.
